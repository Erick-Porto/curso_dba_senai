<h2><i class="fas fa-book-dead"></i> O Pergaminho da Criação: RPG_Mundo</h2>
  <p>Antes de manipularmos os dados, bravos escribas, precisamos entender a estrutura do nosso reino, <strong>RPG_Mundo</strong>. O script SQL a seguir é o mapa ancestral que define as terras, criaturas, heróis e magias.</p>
  <p>Este pergaminho contém os comandos <code>CREATE DATABASE</code> e <code>CREATE TABLE</code>, que são parte da <strong>DDL (Data Definition Language)</strong> - a linguagem dos Arquitetos Divinos - e também comandos <code>INSERT</code> iniciais para popular nosso mundo com suas primeiras lendas.</p>
  <p>Vocês podem copiar e executar este script em seu SGBD (MySQL Workbench ou similar) para ter seu próprio reino de <strong>RPG_Mundo</strong> para praticar os feitiços DML!</p>
